# FlashCards

## Abstract
- Make test suites for a quiz-game functions. 
- Make quiz-game functions
- Ensure proper working before connecting all parts and testing out the integrated functionality. 
- Ensure that functions follow SRP and make functions pure when feasible. 
- Keep the functions and test code as DRY as possible. 

## Context
- At the time of making this project, I've been a Turing student for 7 weeks. 
- This project took me about 6 hours.
- My last project was Rock, Paper, Scissors ([Repository](https://github.com/taranveersingh93/rockPaperScissors), [Deployment](https://taranveersingh93.github.io/rockPaperScissors/))

## Technologies used

- Javascript
- Mocha
- Chai

## Install/Setup

- Go to your terminal
- Run commannd `git clone git@github.com:taranveersingh93/flashcards.git`
- Run command `cd flashcards`
- Run command `npm install`
- Run command `npm test` to run all the tests
- Run command `node.js` to launch the game

## Challenges

- Writing tests before the functions initially slowed me down. However, it helped me focus on one function at a time and also make my functions granular. 
- Not getting to see your current version of code run in flesh felt disorienting to me. There was no way around this but to accept that this is going to be how one contributes to an organization. One function at a time.

## Wins
- I maintained good atomic commits and was able to make tests for all the functions returning a value.
- Despite this being a solo project, I linked each commit with a github project issue to start adopting a collaborative habit. This too forced me to be conscious of my next steps and stay on track. 
- I used beforeEach to DRY up my tests.
- Since this is the first time I used tests, **I did run into quite a few error messages but playing off of those error messages, I got to the resolve quickly as well.**
